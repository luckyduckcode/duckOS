duckOS
-smart game boy (desktop environment on a gaming console). instead of playing games, be able to use the device as a productivity tool. 
create a framework that is small but useful applications can be built on. i realized that most computers from the 90's had about the 
same level of specs as one of these game emulators. so instead of emulating a "gameboy" maybe it could be "smart" and emulate a retro 
computer or even better a custom os and desktop environment that utilizes the input of a gaming console. i am not looking to build an os from scratch,
 but to have a terminal on a gaming system. as well as some basic features and apps that people could enjoy and build on top of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             - i find linux as a topic interesting, and if my "os distro" could be very linuxy then it will provide me hours of entertainment. entertainment is the goal for the device. linux  brings together so many interesting ideas, so this distro is for me, but also Linux enthusiasts that want to be my friend. programmer or not. its definitely an odd approach but personally i think it is cool. basically is a great way to hangout with new and cool people that are interested in tech.
my philosophy is kinda more, lets just hangout and build coolstuff.
and less we need to make the infrastructure for FAANG.

duckOS is an operating system, that is for the anbernic RG351p and will be supported on more devices as we go along. duckOS is an operating system, that is for the anbernic RG351p.
