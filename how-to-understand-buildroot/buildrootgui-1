**Endianness** refers to the order that bytes are stored in a computer's memory.  

* **Little-endian:
** In little-endian systems, the least significant byte (LSB) of a multi-byte value comes first in memory (at the lower memory address). 

* **Big-endian:
** In big-endian systems, the most significant byte (MSB) comes first.

For most of the architectures listed here, there's a single endianness that the architecture uses. However, a few architectures, like ARC, ARM, and MIPS, can be either big or little endian depending on the specific model or configuration.

what best describes rk3326 architecture?

**************************************************************



The RK3326 architecture can be best described as:

* **ARM-based:** It utilizes the ARM Cortex-A35 cores, a common CPU core design from ARM.
* **Quad-core:** It has four processing cores. 
* **Little-endian:** It follows the little-endian byte order for storing data in memory.
* **High-performance for embedded systems:** While not the most powerful overall, it's designed for efficiency and performance within embedded devices.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

* **ARM-based:** The RK3326 is built on ARM architecture, a widely used design for processors in various devices, from smartphones to tablets and embedded systems.
* **Quad-core:** Having four cores allows the RK3326 to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance.
* **Little-endian:** This refers to the way data is stored in memory. In little-endian, the least significant byte comes first.
* **High-performance for embedded systems:** The RK3326 is optimized for embedded devices like single-board computers or retro handheld consoles. It offers good processing power while maintaining efficiency.
